I am a Ph.D. candidate in Civil Engineering at Stony Brook University, specializing in high-fidelity computational modeling of environmental fluid dynamics and renewable energy systems. I conduct research within Dr. Ali Khosronejad’s group and the U.S. Department of Energy–funded Atlantic Marine Energy Center (AMEC).

My research expertise spans computational fluid dynamics (CFD), large-eddy simulation (LES), high-performance computing (HPC), and physics-guided machine learning for horizontal marine hydrokinetic (MHK) turbines and farms. I develop site-specific, multi-scale numerical models that resolve turbulence and flow–structure interactions in energetic tidal and riverine environments, integrating high-resolution geospatial data and field observations. These simulations are used for resource characterization, feasibility assessment, and performance evaluation of pre-commercial marine hydrokinetic (MHK) technologies.

My publication record includes peer-reviewed articles in Renewable Energy and related journals, and extensive experience in scientific programming, large-scale data analysis, and technical writing. I work effectively both independently and within multidisciplinary research teams, collaborating across fluid mechanics, renewable energy, and computational science. My research background provides a strong foundation for energy-focused modeling using numerical and machine learning approaches and uncertainty quantification relevant to research environments. asfdds
